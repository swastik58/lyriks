### The design of an application like Spotify made with the ShazamCore API

## This application contains different other pages like the Top Artists, Top Charts, Song Details etc.

## The songs displayed are all from ShazamCore API.
- The songs are played for 1:30 mins 
- Full songs are not there

## You can discover different genres of songs using the genre picker alongside Discover

## Top Artists displays the top artists currently in the world
## Top Charts displays the top songs in the world currently

## Click on a song to start playing it. You can adjust volume, skip to next song and also shuffle songs.

## In the search bar, you can search for songs, albums, artists etc.
- If something is not available then it is due to the fact that the data is not present in the API

### I tried to make it as much responsive as possible. Please forgive me for any mistakes.
